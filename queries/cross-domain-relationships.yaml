name: Find all Cross-domain Relationships
description: |
   The following query will identify all the cross domain relationships, it would be possible to refine it 
   to find specific relationship types like cross-domain sessions and so on:
   ```cypher
   MATCH (n)-[r]->(m)
   WHERE NOT toUpper(n.domain)= toUpper(m.domain)
   RETURN LABELS(n)[0], n.name, TYPE(r), LABELS(m)[0],m.name
   ```
   This query however does not cover sidHistory attributes in user objects, it is therefore recommended to manually run the following LDAP query manually:
   ```
   (sidHistory=*)
   ```
type: graph

   MATCH (n)-[r]->(m)
   WHERE NOT toUpper(n.domain)= toUpper(m.domain)
   RETURN LABELS(n)[0], n.name, TYPE(r), LABELS(m)[0],m.name
