name: Computers with Admin Rights Over Other Computers
type: table
description: |
   This query will identify all the computer accounts that have admin rights over another computer.
   If results are not empty, it would be then possible to verify that SMB signing is disabled on the target machine.
   Without SMB signing enforced, an attacker would be able to use the PrintSpooler bug to coerce the computer account with admin rights to
   connect to a machine we control and then perform an NTLM relay attacks.
   Query:
   ```cypher
   MATCH (c1:Computer)-[r:AdminTo]->(c2:Computer)
   OPTIONAL MATCH (c1)-[:MemberOf*1..]->(g:Group)-[:AdminTo]->(c2)
   RETURN c1.name,c2.name
   ```
